# Machine Learning for Early Disease Detection

Created ensemble models which suggest genetic information indicative of a neurodegenerative disease, and predict if a patient has the disease

Used Random Forest and Lasso models for important feature identification. Ran identified features through Gradient Boosted models to predict if a patient has the disease and find most important features for prediction

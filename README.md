# Machine Learning for Early Disease Detection

Worked with precision medicine company Simpatica Medicine to create ensemble models which suggest genetic information indicative of a neurodegenerative disease, and predict if a patient has the disease

Used Random Forest and Lasso models for important feature identification. Ran identified features through Gradient Boosted models to predict if a patient has the disease and find most important features for prediction

**NOTE:**
Due to privacy concerns, the nature of the genomic data and the specific disease that I was working with will not be revealed. Therefore,  my files have been updated to remove confidential information. Additionally, any EDA and data transformation will not be available.

# Lupus-Detection-and-Gene-Expression

Created ensemble models which suggest gene expressions indicative of Lupus, and predict if a patient has Lupus

Used Random Forest and Lasso models for important gene identification. Ran identified genes through Gradient Boosted models to predict if a patient has lupus and find most important genes for prediction
